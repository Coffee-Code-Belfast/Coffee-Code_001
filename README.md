## Welcome to the first Coffee&Code Belfast!

Today's challenge is to build a landing page for a Startup (a made up or real one, you choose!). It can be as simple or elaborate as you'd like. The minimum requirements are a business title, an image, and a sign up or subscribe button.
Additional features may include any or all of the following: button linking to a contact form, nav bar, Google maps, social media links.

Ideally, the landing page will be mobile responsive. You can use Flexbox, CSS Grid or Bootstrap.
